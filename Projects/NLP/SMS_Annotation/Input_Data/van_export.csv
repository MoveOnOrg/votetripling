Hashem and his wife from Pittsburgh have decided to raise their children here because Hashem saw the US as a blessing for ways of making decisions that are Science-based and respect the rules. He describes the last 4 years as very sad and unexcusable. He's worried that his VBM ballot will not count and asked me for my opinion. I reassured him that he follow his wife's decision to VBM. He seemed more secure, but spoke of being in the car on a drive back from Johnstown where he saw almost nothing but TRUMP signs. He worries that PA could be lost by Biden in 2020. I took that as my opportunity to tell him why I am volunteering to reach out and express my views responsibly, and asked if he might do the same at the hospital with other healthcare workers. He said Yes because he believes that the handling of the pandemic couldn't be any more dangerous for him and his colleagues. Therefore, he must speak to them in good conscience! I thanked Hashem for becoming a citizen and that I was truly privileged to have spoken with him today. He humbly thanked me!!"
